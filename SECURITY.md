# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the current version of the software only. Typically this means the security issue must be present in the `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We support privately reporting security vulnerabilities within GitHub. For instructions on how to do so we recommend following [this wiki page](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/report-and-fix-vulnerabilities/report-a-vulnerability/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
